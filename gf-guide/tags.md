# Tagging process

<div class="callout">

üêù Since 2024, you can find different typographic categories on <a href="https://fonts.google.com/">Google Fonts</a> , making it easier to sort fonts and allowing users to refine their search.
<p>
A new step has therefore been added to the font onboarding process, managed by the font onboarders, involving the use of a specially designed tool (*GF Tagger*, written by Marc Foley ‚úåÔ∏è) to facilitate the addition of tags.

## How do Tags work?

Users can now select tags from various filter categories, which are grouped into main sections:

- **Feeling** 
- **Appearance**
- **Calligraphy**
- **Serif**
- **Sans Serif**
- **Technology**
- **Seasonal**

The chosen categories and the number of fonts matching these criteria are displayed at the top of the selection panel.

## The process


Tagging a new font takes place when the pull request (PR) for that font is ready in the Google Fonts repository, similar to designer profile submissions. Typically, each font receives between 2 and 6 tags, ensuring a variety of tag types. Each font should have at least one or two tags related to appearance or feeling, along with a tag for structural elements such as serifs.

After selecting a tag (e.g., `Cute`), a percentage value must be assigned to rank the font relative to others in the same category. **GF Tagger** provides a list of fonts associated with each tag, allowing for accurate comparison and value assignment.

**How to define tags for a new font?**


1. Open [GF Tagger](https://google.github.io/fonts/tags.html), and keep the font visible to reference its design.
2. In `Add Family`, add the name of the new font family you are tagging.
3. Select a tag that best describes the font and assign a value next to the font family name. Once added, the tag will appear in the `History` section. Repeat this step for each necessary tag.
